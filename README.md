vlregexp
========

Popular use cases for regexp. For lasy or lower level coders, so that they do not have to use regexp and can use easy to use static functions.

### Welcome to vlregexp!
This class will allow for lazy programming popular regexp cases with minimum or no effort to learn regexp it self:

```
You will see camel cased functions in here and documented functions;
You might notice country short code (for example lv or en or uk) for functions that most likely will be used in these areas, but the rest of the functions will be marked as g - meaning global. For example lvlFormPersonCode. It might not make any sense to those who do not know what a person code is, but in Latvia it makes sanse;
You might see many other functions as this is an open source project and anyone can contribute to it;
```

IMPORTANT: Please use the example class to write your own functions for this class and follow the guidelines provided. Please try to keep the writing style as seamless as possible when adding your own use cases as it is important to keep the code documented and understandable for everyone - not only the guys who can just read the code and all swings...

Having trouble? May be if you leave a comment someone will try to fix it :)
